# AWS-ETL-Data-Pipeline-in-Python-on-YouTube-Data


1. Source Systems
Source Systems represent various data sources generating raw data.
Data from these systems is bulk-loaded or streamed via S3 API into Amazon S3.
2. Data Lake
The Data Lake is hosted on Amazon S3, and it consists of three key areas:
Landing Area: This is where raw, unprocessed data is stored upon ingestion.
Cleansed/Enriched Area: Data is processed, cleaned, and transformed here for analytics.
Analytics/Reporting Area: Final, processed data ready for reporting and analytical queries.
3. Data Processing
AWS Glue: Used for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tasks. It processes raw data from the landing area and moves it to the cleansed/enriched area.
AWS Lambda: Serverless functions handle lightweight transformations or event-driven processing tasks.
4. Data Catalog and Classification
AWS Glue Data Catalog:
Maintains metadata about the data stored in S3.
Helps classify and organize data into a searchable format.
This enables easy access for queries and analytics.
5. Analytics and Querying
AWS Athena: A serverless query engine used to run SQL queries directly on the data in S3. It queries data in the cleansed/enriched or analytics areas for reporting purposes.
QuickSight: A business intelligence (BI) tool that creates visualizations, dashboards, and reports based on the data processed and queried.
6. Monitoring and Alerts
AWS CloudWatch:
Tracks metrics and logs for the entire system.
Provides alerts for failures, anomalies, or performance issues in the data pipeline.
7. Analytical Data Access
API: Enables programmatic access to analytics or processed data.
This allows integration with external applications for further data consumption.
Summary of Data Flow
Data ingestion happens via S3 API into the Landing Area of the Data Lake.
Data is processed using AWS Glue and optionally transformed further with AWS Lambda.
Metadata is managed by AWS Glue Data Catalog for classification and searchability.
Processed data is analyzed using AWS Athena, visualized with QuickSight, and accessed via APIs.
System performance and health are monitored using AWS CloudWatch.
This architecture provides a scalable, serverless, and cost-effective approach to managing data lakes and enabling analytics. Let me know if you want more details on specific components!
